# vehicle-route-optimization
Built an adjacency matrix for a graph representing different cities at different nodes. Assigned weights to the edges which represented the distance or time taken for the vehicle to go from one city to another. This framework can also be implemented on supply chain optimization and Travelling salesman problem.
